## Code Style & Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples in the docblock
- If Bun native modules are available, use them
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes unless needed
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Use proper jsdoc comments for functions, types, interfaces, and ensure examples are accurate
