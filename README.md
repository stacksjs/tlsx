# Zero-Config & Setup HTTPS

> A zero-config reverse proxy for local development with SSL support, custom domains, and more.

## Features

- Reverse Proxy
- SSL Support _(HTTPS by default)_
- Custom Domains _(with wildcard support)_
- Auto HTTP-to-HTTPS Redirection
- `/etc/hosts` Management _(auto-updating)_
- Dependency-Free Binary
- Zero-Config Setup

## Install

```bash
bun install -d tlsx
```

_Alternatively, you can install:_

```bash
brew install tlsx # wip
pkgx install tlsx # wip
```

## Get Started

There are two ways of using this reverse proxy: _as a library or as a CLI._

### Library

Given the npm package is installed:

```js
import { startProxy } from 'tlsx'

startProxy({
  from: 'localhost:3000',
  to: 'my-project.localhost' // or try 'my-project.test'
})
```

### CLI

```bash
tlsx --from localhost:3000 --to my-project.localhost
tlsx --from localhost:8080 --to my-project.test --keyPath ./key.pem --certPath ./cert.pem
tlsx --help
tlsx --version
```

## Configuration

The Reverse Proxy can be configured using a `tlsx.config.ts` _(or `tlsx.config.js`)_ file and it will be automatically loaded when running the `tlsx` command.

```ts
// tlsx.config.ts (or tlsx.config.js)
export default {
  'localhost:3000': 'stacks.localhost'
}
```

_Then run:_

```bash
tlsx start
```

To learn more, head over to the [documentation](https://tlsx.sh/).

## Testing

```bash
bun test
```
